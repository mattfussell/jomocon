    </h2>

    <p>
      JoMoCon is an up and coming Joplin, Missouri fandom convention, and you've made it to our official website - Welcome! The convention will be virtual this year, featuring (with your help!) fan panels, guest appearances, and a couple of features we're not ready to show off just yet. ;) We're putting on this convention because Joplin is missing a con to call it's own, and as adults with busy lives, we need something that fits our schedule. What fills that gap? Nerd Pop Culture to the Rescue!
    </p>
    <p>
      We're doing this to raise money for Hearts and Hammers. They're a local non-profit organization that provides home repairs for the elderly, disabled, and low-income members of our community free of charge. They focus primarily on exterior repairs that improve weatherproofing and security, but they will also take on interior projects and small tasks.

      Who is the <span class="bigger">J</span>o<span class="bigger">M</span>o<span class="bigger">C</span>on <span class="bigger">C</span>ommittee?
    </h2>

    <p>
      The JoMoCon committee is a small group of friends and like-minded indivduals with a passion for culture, pop and otherwise. That's the fancy way to say we're geeks brought together by interests. Literature, movies, anime, manga, comics, gaming, martial and culinary arts all influence how we define ourselves and our shared experiences. In January of 2020, we started taking the steps to bring a convention that would expand these experiences to everyone else. There were ... a lot. But now that we've got all the legal bits squared away, we're ready to bring things to life.

        <p class="cardAbout hidden">Jason Bright is a public school teacher by day and a convention organizer by moonlight. Ever since attending his first anime convention, he has been hopelessly hooked on the experiences that come from such an event. Jason lives for cult classic cinema, FPS and RTS gaming, and all things cyberpunk; not to mention a recent obsession with vapowave music and pixel gif art.</p>

         <p class="cardAbout hidden">Dawn Bright is an employment specialist, when she isn't archiving the activities of the Committee,creating our connections with guest speakers, or keeping Jason on track. Ever the eclectic, she boasts a broad range of fandom love from the sagas of Jim Butcher and sherrilyn McQueen to series like Yu Yu Hakusho and and so much more.To top it all off, she is a jack of all trades in the world of card games.</p>

        <p class="cardAbout hidden">Drew Cates is the unofficial engineer of the Committee. This makes sense considering his handyman skills and background in welding. An average evening for Drew consists of creating amature cosplay while developing Star Wars fanfic, with DS9 marathoning on the TV. He also seems to knows his way around the land of Skyrim better than he does Southwest Missouri.</p>

    <h3>
      The Legal Bits
    </h3>

    <p>
      JoMoCon Committee is a recognized 501(c)(3) charitable nonprofit, and we have two goals: We seek to host an annual convention in Joplin, Missouri that celebrates the many forms of fine art and fandom. We seek to use this convention to support and raise funds for other local charities that positively impact the Joplin community.
